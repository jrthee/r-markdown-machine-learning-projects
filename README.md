# r-markdown-machine-learning-projects
 Multiple machine learning projects coded using R Markdown; projects include authorship analysis, educational data mining
 
 ## Content of folders:
 
 ### Folder: Authorship Attribution_Education Data Mining 
 There are two individual machine learning projects coded within the same R Markdown file. 
 The first project is performing classification to identify the author of the Federalist Papers with disputed authorship.
 The second project uses neural networks to analyze and classify student academic performance based on several attributes related to the students.
 
 ### Folder: Bank Data Analysis
 There are two individual machine learning projects coded within the same R Markdown file.
 The first project uses association rule mining to analyze banking data to classify if a person is likely to enroll in a Personal Equity Plan.
 The second project uses cluster analysis (both k-means and HAC (Hierarchical Clustering)) to identify the author of the Federalist Papers with disputed authorship.
 
 ### Folder: Digit Recognition
 This machine learning project uses a Naive Bayes model and a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) model to classify each handwritten image in the dataset, based on the pixels associated with each image.
